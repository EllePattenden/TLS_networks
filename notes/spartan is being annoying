# 1. strategy in each tick being stored as NA. 
  * this was not right, there was just so few strat updates taking place I didn't notice. All good. 
  
# 2. still out putting networks everytime strategy changes
  * changed so that the proportion of CC, CD, and DC ties is stored instead 
  
# 3. move cleaning script to end of each run... 

# 4. fix tie updating procedure 
  * new tie is now reciprocated. 
  
# 5. 10 runs errored out with a "Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob) : invalid first argument".
