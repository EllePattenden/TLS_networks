########## log / list of things to fix w code shift to Spartan ##########

02/09/22

# 1. strategy in each tick being stored as NA. 
  * this was not right, there was just so few strat updates taking place I didn't notice. All good. 
  
# 2. still out putting networks everytime strategy changes
  * changed so that the proportion of CC, CD, and DC ties is stored instead 
  
# 3. move cleaning script to end of each run... 

# 4. fix tie updating procedure 
  * new tie is now reciprocated. 
  
# 5. 10 runs errored out with a "Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob) : invalid first argument". 
  * located with find . -type f | xargs grep -l  "sample" | xargs grep -n "chunk" 
  * all are runs with degree = 90; working hypothesis is that the error arrises WHEN options = 0 in: 
          # identify  new partner for agent_ii
          options <- setdiff(seq(1, 100, 1),                 # identify potential new partners
                             c(comp[agent == "i", id],       # not self
                               comp[agent == "j", id],       # agent_jj 
                               which(network[comp[agent == "i", id], ] == TRUE) # or current ties
                             ))
          new_mate <- sample(options, 1) 
  * adding if statement to test, which can be removed as soon as we move away from this set of sims
          ** YES ^^ that was it!
